########## NOTES for lepton_pt_capture/scripts/thermalmaster.py ##########
# 1. The class ImagePublish from readimage.py has the node to publish the image
# 2. The class ImageSave from storeimage.py has the node to save the image
# 3. To exit the program, click on the red cross on the top right corner of the button window
# 4. Could not figure out how to stop the node from running after the button is clicked :/
